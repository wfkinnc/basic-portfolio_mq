		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img src="assets/images/wfk.JPG" class="auth-image" alt="William">
			<p>
					I have been a Business Intelligence technologist for over 20 years, starting my IT career while working for NCNB in Greensboro NC. Previous to that, my educational background included a BS in Economics from Va Tech and my MBA from UNC-G. Other, not technical positions included Store Manager at a Domino's Pizza and later collections for banks in Va and NC.<br><br>
					Since beginning my IT career with Information Builders in 1997, I have become proficient in their software, WebFOCUS.  As a consultant in their  Professional Services group, I have worked on projects large and small for all manner of organizations, business and government.  As a consultant, we were epected to also be proficient in rendering technologies including  HTML, CSS and javascript.<br><br>
					My prefernce, though, are back end technologies which cull data from throughout the organization and stage it for quick retrievals through Web enabled reporting solutions. A great number of my past experiences, starting with my first job at NCNB, revolved around the accumulation of data from disparate sources and putting them into a unified structure which enabled quick reporting.
